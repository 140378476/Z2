# Z<sup>2</sup>
 Z<sup>2</sup> is a small game project as the homework of my summer c++ lesson.
 It is a turn-based strategy game played on a chessboard-like tiled plane, which gives it
 the name "Z<sup>2</sup>".
 
 
### Download 
 Direct download of the executable game file is available, as well as a Chinese introduction of this game.

### Dependencies
 The project Z<sup>2</sup> requires C++ 14 and Qt 5.9. 
 
### Open the Project
 The project Z<sup>2</sup> is developed using two IDEs: CLion and QtCreator. We assume that 
 these IDEs are installed. 
 
 First, clone the git repository and open it with CLion. 
 Second, run CMake install with CLion.
 Third, use QtCreator to open Z2.pro in folder qt/Z2, then setup the project (default settings are okay).
 Finally, run the project in QtCreator, and everything is done.
